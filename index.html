        <p>I enjoy reading books a lot. My favorite genre is fantasy. Authors can get really creative about their writing and I really enjoy reading about magical lands or mythical creatures and the characters exploring them. Reading has helped me alot. My volcabulary has increased a ton since I started reading a lot. It also helped me with writing and being creative about it. If you aren't enjoying reading, I can 100% guarantee that its the book you're reading. Explore the complete opposite genre! Keep reading until you find a series or genre to really enjoy. Reading has helped me develop and made be smarter.</p>

    <h1> Chris Colfer and The Land of Stories</h1>
        <p>Growing up I had a special place in my heart for fantasy and fiction in general. One series that soon became my favorite of all time were The Land of Stories by Chris Colfer. The series is about these twins, Connor and Alex Bailey fall into a new dimension from their Grandma's mysterious fairy-tale book. To their shock this world has characters of all fairy tales, Queens like Cinderella, Girls like Goldilocks and Little Red Riding Hood. It had multiple childrens nursery rhyme characters like Humpty Dumpty, Jack and Jill, and Bo peep. That is all I will reveal, go read it.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Chris Colfer has many other series, though I haven't read them. I've heard that he even started another series with magic and assumably fairy-tales. He is also a famous actor. His series include: A Tale of Magic, Struck By Lightning: The Carson Phillips Journal, and of course, The Land of Stories. (He also added add ons to the series like one of the character's backstory)</p>
